## Introduction

**Editor Bar** is a Visual Studio 2022 extension crafted to streamline your coding workflow. It provides an intuitive breadcrumbs bar displaying the file path and current project name, ensuring effortless navigation and management of files, particularly those with identical names across different projects or folders within a solution.

This functionality addresses common challenges when editing files with similar names, such as `launchSettings.json` across multiple projects or within the same project (e.g., `/Pages/Users/Edit.razor`, `/Pages/Roles/Edit.razor`). The breadcrumbs bar provides clear context, reducing confusion and improving navigation efficiency.
